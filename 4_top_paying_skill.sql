 /*Insight are:

1. Skills like SVN ($400K), Solidity ($179K), and Couchbase ($160K) command significantly higher average salaries.

These are less commonly used or domain-specific tools (e.g., Solidity for blockchain,
 SVN for legacy version control), 
indicating lower supply but critical demand in niche areas.

2. Skills such as MXNet ($149K), Keras ($127K), PyTorch ($125K), Hugging Face ($123K), and TensorFlow ($120K) rank high.

This suggests a strong market need for data analysts who can build or work 
with machine learning models, especially in deep learning frameworks.

3. Tools like Terraform ($146K), VMware ($147.5K), Kafka ($130K), Airflow ($116K), and
 Ansible ($124K) reflect a blending of analyst and engineering roles.

Employers value analysts who understand deployment, orchestration, and infrastructure managementâ€”not just analysis.
