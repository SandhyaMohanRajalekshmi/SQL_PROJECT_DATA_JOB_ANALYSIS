# SQL_PROJECT_DATA_JOB_ANALYSIS

This project involves exploratory data analysis on a SQL-based database containing key tables such as job_postings_fact, skills_dim, company_dim, and skills_job_dim. The objective is to apply fundamental SQL operations—including SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, CASE expression, Union, subquery, CTE, Join and filtering clauses—to extract insights and identify important trends. The project strengthens SQL proficiency while uncovering key patterns in job roles, required skills, and company-specific hiring data.
